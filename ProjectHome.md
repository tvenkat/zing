### What is Zing? ###
Zing is an opensocial compliant social Networking Site (SNS) built in Java web technology. It is using Apache’s Java Shindig framework for OpenSocial compliance. While we (see the about us section below) were developing Zing, one of the most important thing for us was to keep it simple. Zing has almost all of the basic SNS features like application gallery, scrapbook, albums, media items, mailing option etc. Yet is very simple and straightforward to understand and use.

**Zing is currently version 0.9 beta**
